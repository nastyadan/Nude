            <div>Hey, here are some important things you should know 👋</div>
            <div>Our investing products (e.g. Nude Stocks & Shares LISA and ISA)<br>If you open a Nude Stocks & Shares
                Lifetime ISA, it’s important that you know the value of your investment could go up as well as down. You
                could get back less than you put in, which means it would take you longer to buy your first home. Past
                performance is not necessarily a guide to the future and investing is not intended to be a short-term
                option. We can’t and don’t provide financial advice so please be sure that investment risk is right for
                you.</div>
            <div>Our LISA and ISA<br>The 25% bonus and tax-free benefits of these accounts depend on government policy
                and tax rules, which can change at any time.</div>
            <div>Market-leading interest rate The term market-leading interest rate is based on our research as at
                03/11/2022.</div>
